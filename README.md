# IRI Profile Parameters

This development focuses on the calculation of the IRI bottomside parameters. For this purpose, we proceed with the fitting of the IRI bottomside function to experimental radar data. We fit to a Chapman layer model to find the best NmF2, hmF2, and H. With these parametric information, we apply the Levenberg-Marquardt method to find B0 and B1 parameters in a least-square sense. The plot below presents an example of our fitting procedure obtained with this [script] (fitIRIProfile.m).
