# IRI Profile Parameters

This development focuses on the IRI bottomside parameters obtained from experimental radar data. Initially, it fits data to a Chapman layer model to find the best NmF2, hmF2, and H. With this information, it applies the Levenberg-Marquardt method to find B0 and B1. Here is an example using radar data taken at the equator.
